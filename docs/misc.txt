 psid ships with some options extending setup.py that may be useful to
 developer or for debugging the package build in different
 environments.  via "paver", psid includes the following build option.

   * python setup.py compose_index
       Fetches versions of packages found in
       'lib/python{version}/site-packages' to $VIRTUAL_ENV/download
       and creates a simple static PyPI style index in $VIRTUAL_ENV/download/simple

   * python setup.py install_pip
       Installs pip, the kinder gentler easy_install

   * python setup.py install_spatialindex
       Installs libspatialindex into $VIRTUAL_ENV/lib/libspatialindex

   * python setup.py install_rtree_egg
       Install Rtree distribution into the current virtualenv, linking
       against $VIRTUAL_ENV/lib/libspatialindex


zc.buildout compatibility

 A buildout.cfg is provided and used by the package build. Though it
 is unsupported for direct use with buildout, it should work with a
 minimal amount of modification.
